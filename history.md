## Changes Log

### Initial Setup
- Created history.md file to track project changes
- Date: 2025-08-03

### Chat Feature Implementation
- Created Chat.tsx page component with ChatGPT/Claude-like interface
- Added chat route to App.tsx routing

  - Typing indicator with animated dots
  - Textarea input with Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line
  - Simulated AI responses (1 second delay)
  - Responsive design with proper spacing and styling
- Fixed shadcn/ui setup by adding import alias to main tsconfig.json
- Initialized shadcn/ui properly with `npx shadcn@latest init`
- Added official shadcn textarea component to replace custom implementation
- Restored original custom theme colors after shadcn init overwrote them
- Kept shadcn component structure but reverted to original blue/glass theme
- Removed problematic @theme and @apply directives that were causing warnings
- Date: 2025-08-03

### Backend Setup
- Created FastAPI backend in `/backend` directory
- Added main.py with three dummy endpoints:
  - `/chat` - Single persona chat endpoint
  - `/multi` - Multi-persona chat endpoint  
  - `/simulation` - Simulation endpoint for persona conversations
- Created pyproject.toml for uv dependency management
- Added requirements.txt for compatibility
- Created backend README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Configured CORS middleware to allow frontend connections
- Used Pydantic models for request/response validation
- All endpoints return dummy responses for initial testing
- Fixed pyproject.toml configuration issues by simplifying build setup
- Server successfully running on port 8001 (port 8000 was in use)
- Verified all endpoints working via FastAPI docs at http://localhost:8001/docs
- Date: 2025-08-04

### LLM Integration Setup
- Added environment variables configuration with .env.example file
- Created config.py for settings management using pydantic-settings
- Built comprehensive LLM client (llm_client.py) supporting:
  - OpenAI Chat Completions API (latest)
  - Claude via Amazon Bedrock API (latest)
  - Google Gemini API (latest)
- Added API parameter to all endpoints to choose LLM provider
- Updated all three endpoints to use real LLM responses with fallback to dummy responses
- Added model, temperature, and max_tokens parameters for fine-tuning
- Updated dependencies: openai, boto3, google-generativeai, pydantic-settings, python-dotenv
- Each endpoint now supports routing to different LLM providers based on 'api' parameter
- Maintained backward compatibility with graceful error handling
- Date: 2025-08-04

### LLM Client Refactor
- Refactored LLM client from class-based to function-based architecture
- Implemented OpenAI Responses API (beta.chat.completions.parse) with structured JSON responses
- Added fallback to regular chat completions if Responses API fails
- Updated default OpenAI model to gpt-4o
- Updated default Claude model to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0
- Replaced llm_client.chat_completion() with direct chat_completion() function calls
- Maintained all existing functionality with improved architecture
- Date: 2025-08-04

### OpenAI Responses API Implementation - Fixed
- Created openai_responses_reference.py with all official examples for future reference
- Replaced complex multi-function approach with single universal function
- Implemented proper back-and-forth conversation support:
  - openai_chat() - Universal function with previous_response_id parameter
  - retrieve_response() - Retrieve previous responses by ID
- Added two clean endpoints:
  - POST /openai-chat - Universal chat with stateful conversation support
  - POST /openai-retrieve - Retrieve previous responses
- Key features properly implemented:
  - previous_response_id parameter for conversation continuity
  - Optional tools parameter for function calling
  - Optional include_reasoning for o3/o4-mini models
  - Proper response parsing with output_text, tool_calls, reasoning_summary
- Fixed the core issue: API now supports proper back-and-forth conversations
- All based on official OpenAI Responses API patterns from examples
- Date: 2025-08-04

### WebSocket Real-time Streaming Implementation
- Added WebSocket endpoint at `ws://localhost:8000/ws` for real-time communication
- Implemented comprehensive streaming functionality:
  - Real-time status updates ("starting", "processing", "streaming", "completed")
  - Chunked response streaming for smooth user experience
  - Support for all existing API patterns (OpenAI chat, persona chat, multi-persona)
- Added websockets==12.0 dependency to requirements.txt
- Created ConnectionManager class for WebSocket connection handling
- Implemented three streaming message types:
  - `openai_chat` - Stream OpenAI Responses API calls with status updates
  - `chat` - Stream single persona responses with character-based replies
  - `multi_chat` - Stream multiple persona responses simultaneously
- Added comprehensive error handling and graceful disconnection management
- Created testing infrastructure:
  - websocket_test_client.py - Python test client with examples
  - websocket_test.html - Interactive HTML test page with UI
  - WEBSOCKET_README.md - Complete documentation and usage guide
- Updated CORS settings to support WebSocket connections
- Features include:
  - Chunked streaming (50 chars for OpenAI, 30 chars for personas)
  - Real-time progress indicators during API calls
  - Stateful conversation support via WebSocket
  - Multiple concurrent connection support
  - Production-ready error handling and connection lifecycle management
