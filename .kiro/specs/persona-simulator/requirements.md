# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Persona Simulator is a B2B marketing tool that enables users to create AI-powered personas from uploaded lists and simulate interactions with these personas to test marketing ideas, messaging, and strategies. The system creates a one-to-one mapping between list entries and AI personas, allowing marketers to validate their approaches before real-world implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a B2B marketer, I want to upload a list of target audience data, so that I can generate corresponding AI personas for testing my marketing strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a list file THEN the system SHALL parse the list and extract individual entries
2. WHEN the list is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL create one AI persona for each list entry
3. IF the uploaded file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats
4. WHEN personas are generated THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation with the number of personas created

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a B2B marketer, I want each AI persona to have distinct characteristics based on the list data, so that I can simulate realistic interactions with different audience segments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a persona is created from list data THEN the system SHALL generate unique personality traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns
2. WHEN displaying a persona THEN the system SHALL show the persona's key characteristics and background information
3. WHEN multiple personas exist THEN each persona SHALL have distinguishable attributes and responses
4. IF list data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL generate reasonable defaults while maintaining persona uniqueness

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a B2B marketer, I want to simulate actions and interactions with individual personas, so that I can test how different audience segments might respond to my marketing approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a persona THEN the system SHALL provide an interface for simulating interactions
2. WHEN a user inputs a marketing message or action THEN the persona SHALL respond in character based on their defined traits
3. WHEN simulating an interaction THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and persona consistency
4. WHEN an interaction is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to save or export the simulation results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a B2B marketer, I want to manage my persona audiences and simulation sessions, so that I can organize and track my testing activities across different campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN personas are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to view all generated personas in a list or grid format
2. WHEN viewing personas THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or duplicate personas
3. WHEN conducting simulations THEN the system SHALL save interaction history for future reference
4. WHEN managing multiple audience lists THEN the system SHALL allow users to organize personas into groups or campaigns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a B2B marketer, I want to export simulation results and insights, so that I can share findings with my team and incorporate learnings into my marketing strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulation sessions are complete THEN the system SHALL provide export options for results
2. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL include persona responses, interaction summaries, and key insights
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
4. IF no simulations exist THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging and guidance for getting started
